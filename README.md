## Overview

This is the source code for an simple game starting point in Phaser 3.  
This project uses no tooling and is intended for beginners to easily start developing games for the web.

## Getting Started

The project in Phaser 3 with Modern JavaScript book suggests using the Live Server extension for Visual Studio Code to launch a development server.

JavaScript files are included via the `<script type="module">` tag. A modern browser like Chrome is recommended.
